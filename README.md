# BaseDiscordBot

This is the base foundation for a Discord bot, i added a few example commands.


# Installation

To install the bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. run `npm i` to install the required dependencies
3. create a new `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables
   (see `.env.example` for an example)
4. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the commands to your server
5. Run `npm start` to start the bot

Note: You will need to create a Discord bot and invite it to your server in order to use this bot. Instructions for creating a bot and inviting it to a server can be found in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/).
